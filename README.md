## About the Project
This is a school project developed with Vue.js and Vite, utilizing Bootstrap for layout and Chart.js for charts. The project utilizes the CoinCap API to fetch cryptocurrency data. Bootstrap Icons are used for icons and Vue Router is used for single-page application (SPA) navigation. Pinia is used for state management, while npm packages like Axios and uuid are used to facilitate development.

The primary focus with this project was to gain experience working with Vue.js, handling API calls, state management, and creating dynamic user interfaces.

## Features
